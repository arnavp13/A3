    <p> I used census data for this visualization. It gives me three important statistics: the total population, the
        average level of education, and the average median income for each county within the major cities. My goal was
        to display possible connections between these factors without making the visual misleading. To do this, I chose
        a simple scatter plot with two simple axes: the x-axis shows "Avg. Educational Attainment" and the y-axis shows
        "Avg. Median Income" (in dollars). The labels are very clear, and the scales are smooth from zero on, which
        keeps the data from looking skewed.</p>

    <p> Since the dataset covers a lot of different areas, I used color to show the population of each county. There is
        a the key on the right side that shows how the color scale works and what each point's color means based on its
        total population. This lets people see how areas with differing populations have different levels of schooling
        and income without getting in the way of the main plot. The audience can make their own assumptions and
        connection with population without the graph trying to mislead them. There are no axis breaks or exaggerated
        scaling used in any of the data transformations. For example, the average median income and educational
        achievement are found by adding up all the data points.</p>

    <p> To keep things simple, the chart has a consistent color scheme, a balanced layout of axis tick marks, and no
        useless features. The scatter map also shows that there isn't a single outlier that stands out or is hidden.
        Instead, there is a wide range of points. This large amount of data makes sure that the visualization doesn't
        depend on picking out outliers.</p>

    <p> Overall, this visualization tries to show the data honestly and correctly by using a simple scatter plot with
        color-coding for population, as well as clear labels and consistent scales. This is an example of a "white hat"
        approach that is focused on being honest and easy to understand rather than trying to trick someone.</p>

    <h1>WRITE UP FOR BLACKHAT:</h1>
    <br>
    <p>This visualization shows the demographic percentage of each race in each city. in addition to the graph not
        showing a clear visual message of the demographics in each city, there are also few elements that can lead to a
        misleading message. The visuals of this graph are not pleasant to loock at. The x-axis labels are vertical making it hard
        to read. They are also cluttered and too long for the user to read. The idea to combine multiple bar charts into
        one is not appealing and may be hard for a viewer to understand what they are looking at.</p>

    <p> The first such misleading technique that is used is the filtering of data. Some of the races present are less
        than 1% a part of the total population of each city. Therefore, I have filtered the data by adjusting the start
        of the Y-axis so that it does not show the bar of the races that are below that certain threshold. From the
        visual, you can see that those bars do not exist. This can be misleading as for simple viewers it gives the idea
        that those races do not exist at all in the city with just 4 big races making up the majority of the
        population. </p>

    <p> Another technique that can be misleading is the title. The title “Dominant Races by City” suggests
        visualizations that show empowering races in each city. Although this can bring the attention of the viewer when
        they first view the graph, it can be misleading as it just showcases which races are mostly present in each city
        with some being left out. This can also bring the idea of a lack of diversity even though there is a very small
        percentage of certain races that are not shown in the graph.</p>

    <p> Aside from the misleading information, one of the biggest features that is included, which is a big part of the
        entirety of the graph, was the calculation of race percentage. With just raw numbers being present, the
        percentage of each race per city was calculated which helped in creating the above graphs with accuracy.
        Similarly, a legend with each race being color coordinated is present as this helps each race stand out from
        each other allowing you to see each data.</p>
